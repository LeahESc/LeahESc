# Hi, I'm Leah! 

I'm an inquisitive and driven full-stack software engineer skilled in React, JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, SQL, HTML and CSS. As a developer, I'm inspired and motivated to learn from others and experiment with new technologies and programming languages. The limitless power of programming never ceases to amaze me and continues to propel me to becoming the best developer I can be. 

After majoring in Art History + Creative Writing in college, I transitioned into marketing and communications which gave me the ability to weave my story-telling skills with my passion for designing eye-catching and communicative materials. I enjoyed marketing but always felt like I was just outside of the action until I had the opportunity to redesign and build a new website for a non-profit organization. Working on the website opened my eyes to the world of programming. It was the most fulfilled I had felt in my professional career. I loved being able to play around with custom CSS stylesheets and learning how to craft my own styles and layout. I was hooked.
